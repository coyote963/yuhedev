## Hi there ##

I'm Yuhe, a software developer living in Ohio. I specialize in web development, but I am always looking to expand my skillset. 

Right now my interests are in web development, mobile app development as well as machine learning.

Through my blog, I plan to document the various projects I am working on, challenges I face, as well as small triumphs. But most importantly I hope that the blog will help me to organize my thoughts.
